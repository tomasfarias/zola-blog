This is my personal blog, powered by [zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

# Why zola?

I was looking into a static file site generator that could work with Markdown files and the two best options I could find where [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) and [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). Due to my familiarity with [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) templates, and my urge to try out a new Rust tool, I went with the former. That being said, I don't think there was a wrong choice in that decision.
